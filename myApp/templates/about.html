      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>
        With several decades of experience and exposure, Doctor Emua has been
        helping and saving hundreds of lives from all over the world from
        different continents, religion, tribe or race. Unlike modern doctors,
        Doctor Emua focuses purely on using natureâ€™s gifts in the production of
        Herbal Supplements which have been tested over the years to help to cure
        a wide range of illnesses, diseases and so forth. If a person looks
        deeply into the current norms, practices and ways with which modern
        science operate these days, one would be very careful to trust the whole
        system. Not to belittle the great effort of most doctors who have
        studied and worked hard in the system, but to state that all practices
        passed down to them as knowledge and research may be half truths or
        carefully calculated knowledge passed so as to drive certain agendas and
        policies for a select greddy and mischievous few. It is not very
        difficult to note that morden healthcare has neglected championing the
        need to promote healthy living and lifestyle, but rather are concerned
        with solving health issues. We also know that there are lots of health
        institutions that are covertly for profits and business. Infact these
        institutions are among the largest in the health sector and these
        include pharmacies and companies who provide health equipment
        (specifically for certain conditions). So not to sound so much like a
        conspiracy theorist, it should now be becoming common sense to know that
        there are persons who profit from our health issues or illness. And this
        is the reason why in the last 5 decades, there has been more than 150
        "incurable" illnesses that has been said to be discovered and these
        illnesses need a constant intake of certain drugs or a constant
        procedure to manage, and like you know, these things aren't cheap. I
        mean if your aren't paying for it, then your tax money is probably
        paying for it like in some areas. So people, don't you think the best
        thing a person should do is to learn to live a healthy life, eat well,
        and get natural cures for whatever ailment befalls the person ? It is
        now my job as a seasoned practitioner in herbal and holistic medicine to
        do the best I can to enlighten and educate persons on the importance of
        good living and plant based lifestyle and also to cure those suffering
        from lingering health issues. Contact us today for advice or to get a
        cure from the issue you have
