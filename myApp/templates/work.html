          All your details are sent directly to Doctor Emua and he will check
          over fully and may come back to you with any questions he needs, which
          will allow him to prescribe your treatment safely and effectively. If
          there are no questions needed, doctor Emua will approve the medication
          and your order will be ready to dispatch. In some circumstances, a
          medication may not be suitable for you, in these instances, your money
          is refunded and the doctor will let you know that the medication is
          unsuitable for you. Don’t be disheartened by this, it is always for
          your own safety.
